I)	Real Estate : A real estate agency wanted to reduce the negotiation time and improve closure for buyers and sellers of homes by ensuring that both sides were advised well on the potential sale/purchase price of the home. To that end the agency wanted to predict a transaction price for all the houses in its market which would be as close as possible to a price where the transaction would take place. Data regarding all possible variables and qualities of  houses sold in the past was collected and analyzed.
